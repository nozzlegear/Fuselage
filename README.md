# Fuselage
Fuselage is a customizable blog and personal website for developers. Rather than being driven by a CMS backend, Fuselage relies on git and a simple index.json file to track posts. You can see Fuselage being used in production at [https://nozzlegear.com](https://nozzlegear.com).

# Coming soon.

Fuselage was recently converted from an ASP.NET + Azure Storage backend to NodeJS + HapiJS with TypeScript and React-rendered views. These docs will soon be updated with instructions for using Fuselage.
