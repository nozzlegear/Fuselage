You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to Fuselage's markdown system and get you started. You can manage your content with the /posts/index.json file in your project's root folder. 

## Getting Started

Fuselage uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write. If you've ever used a README file, filed an issue or created a pull request on GitHub, you're probably already familiar with Markdown.

Writing in Markdown is really easy. In your Markdown file, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:

* Item number one
* Item number two
    * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. Here's a link to [the Fuselage website](https://github.com/nozzlegear/fuselage). Neat.

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Fuselage Logo](http://placehold.it/250x250/34495e/ffffff/&text=Fuselage)

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said.

> Eu occaecat sit cupidatat esse qui id.

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.
